# Belly Button Diversity

## Project Overview

Many species of bacteria lives in harmony with the human body and recent studies have shown that many species live in our belly buttons. Belly Button Biodiversity investigates the different species of bacteria living in our belly button. Using data collected from volunteers, the aim of this project was to create a interactive dashboard to allow volunteers of the study and other interested persons to visualize the different bacteria cultures living in our belly buttons.
